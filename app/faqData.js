      question: "What are the different types of EV chargers?",
      answer: "There are generally three types of EV chargers:\n\n1. Level 1: Uses a standard household outlet (120V in North America), providing a slow charge suitable for overnight charging.\n\n2. Level 2: Requires a dedicated 240V connection, often installed at homes, workplaces, and public locations. It charges faster than Level 1, usually adding around 20–30 miles of range per hour.\n\n3. DC Fast Chargers (Level 3): Found at commercial and public charging stations, these use direct current at high voltages to rapidly charge EVs—often from 20% to 80% in about 30 minutes, depending on the vehicle."
